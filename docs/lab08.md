Intro

Recursion does not involve new syntax. Instead it is just a new way of attacking a problem.

If you are struggling to grasp recursion, the best way to get better is to practice :)
Below are a few exercises to practice on.

Exercise 1
---
Write a function that takes in a pointer and recursively prints a null terimnated array in order.
You are given the function header:

```c++
void printArrayForward(char * ptr){
    //K
}
```

Exercise 2
---
Write a function that takes in a pointer and recursively prints a null terminated array in **reverse** order.
You are given the function header:

```c++
void printArrayBackwards(char * ptr){
    //r
}
```

Exercise 3
---
You are given a pointer to the beginning of an array and a pointer to the end of the same array.
Write a function that passes in both of these pointers and reverses the order of the array recursively.

```c++
void reverseArray(char * left, char * right){
  //i
}
```

Excercise 4
---
Write a function that takes in a number `n` and returns the nth number of the fibonnaci sequence recursively.
Remeber that the fibonacci sequence is made by summing the two numbers prior in the list.

ex: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ....

```c++
int fibonucci(int n){
   //s
}
```

Excercise 5
---
Write a function that recursively calculates the factorial of a number n.
Rember that the factorial is calculated by multiplying all the numbers smaller than n.

```c++
int factorial(int n){
    //M
}
```

Excercise 6
---
Write a function that returns the greatest common denominator of two numbers a and b recursively.
There is a specific algorithm to this one to make this function easy. 
Ask your SI leader if you need help :)

```c++
int gcd(int a, int b){
  //il
}
```

Exercise 7
---
Write a function that crashes your program with a stack overflow.
Yes, we inted for you to write a program that breaks.

```c++
void stackOverflow(){
   //ler
}
```

Exercise 8
---
Ask your SI leader for help if you need it and good job doing the lab :)
