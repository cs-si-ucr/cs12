Factorial
---

Write a function that accepts and integer, and returns the factorial of that integer.
The function should be written recursively (no loops!).

The factorial function is defined mathematically as `n! = n*(n-1)!`

Also, `0! = 1` and `1! = 1`

Return `-1` for all negative inputs.


strlen
---

Write the `strlen` function recursively.

`strlen` accepts a cstring to return the size of.


strcpy
---

Wrrithe the `strcpy` function recursively.

`strcpy` accepts two strings, and stores the contents of one to the other.
