Point
---

The `Point` class can be found [here](https://github.com/cs-si-ucr/cs12/blob/master/etc/Point.cpp).

Points here, semantically, are different from the `Point` covered in lecture.
Instead of simply storing the coordinates, these Points behave like mathematical vectors.
As such, their interface is different.

Before continuing,
1. Look over the `Point` interface to understand how to use this class.
2. Separate the `Point` definition from its declaration.


Rectangle
---

Go to piazza and copy Kris's `Rectangle` interface as covered in lecture.

Implement each function using this new `Point` class.
