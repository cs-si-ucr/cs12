I have a copy of midterm 2.
If you have any questions, we will go over them.


Recursion
---

Copy the code below and play with it to get a feel for recursion:

```c++
void recursiveFunction(int parameter) {
    cout << "called with (" << parameter << ')' << endl;
    if (parameter <= 0) {
        cout << "Base case reached!" << endl;
        return;
    }
    recursiveFunction(parameter-1);
    cout << "returned from calling with (" << parameter-1 << ')' << endl;
}
```
