Today we will go over class inheritance.

Inheritance is a powerful tool that can be used to make less work for you!
It also allows us to create classes with interesting relationships to each other.


Is A vs Has A
---

Up until now, to do something similar to recursion you'd have to copy all the code of one class to another.

This makes it harder to maintain the code, because any future changes would need to be duplicated;
miss one and you introduce bugs!

In the case of the `Basket` class from a few weeks ago, we explored a Has-A relationship between the `Fruit` class and `Basket` class.
(`Basket` *Has A* `Fruit`)

With inheritance, we will explore an *Is A* relationship.

For instance, we could have a base `Fruit` class, and specialize it to an `Apple` or `Orange` class


Practice

What is the relationship between the following classes?
(Is A, Has A, or None)

* `Iron` and `Atom`

* `Vehicle` and `Car`

* `Car` and `Motorcycle`

* `Building` and `Chair`

* `Duck` and `Animal`

* `School` and `UCR`
