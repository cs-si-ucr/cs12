`cin` array of integers
---

Write the following function:

```c++
istream& operator>>(istream&, int**);
```

You may assume that the stream only contains valid integers.
You may also assume that the first integer will indicate how many integers will follow until the end of the stream.

After the integers in the stream, there will be nothing else.


Point class with dynamic memory
---

Write the `Point` class with the following `private` data:

```c++
class Point {
    private:
        double* data;
};
```


In-place array merge
---

Write a function that will merge two parts of an array in-place.

```c++
void merge(int* arr, int middle, int size);
```

* `arr` is the start of the whole array
* `middle` is the offset to the right portion of the array
* `size` is the number of elements in the array
