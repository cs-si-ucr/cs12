CS 10 Review

1) Draw a conceptual model of a variable. Label the address, name, and contents of your variable at a minimum.

2) Use your model from part 1 to draw a conceptual model of a vector.

3) Descrive the difference between passing a variable by value and passing a variable by reference.

4) List some types that should almost always be passed by reference. Why is this the case?

5) Write a function that swaps the contents of two variables of type char.

6) Write a function that reverses all the strings in a vector of strings.

7) Write a function that takes as input a vector of strings and does the following:
   Output 'True' to the terminal if more than half the strings in the vector have a length greater than 6.
   Output 'False' to the terminal otherwise.
