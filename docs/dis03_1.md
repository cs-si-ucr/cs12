Introduction
---

This week you learned about structs and classes.

We will focus on classes because structs are basically the same thing (in `c++`).

For this discussion and for lab tomorrow, we will explore how classes work by making our own.

Classes (and the objects that are made from them) are often used to model real-world situations.
The particular case we will be exploring is that of a small fruit stand at a market.

To keep track of inventory, we model each item as a particular fruit.
Fruits have a name, a weight, and a price.
The class we will be making will store the name, weight in pounds, price in dollars, and price per pound.
An example of this class's private data members is given below:

```c++
class Fruit {
    private:
        string name;
        double weight;
        double price;
        double pricePerPound;
};
```

Exercise 1

What constructors should we make for this class?
Discuss within your group(s) for a few minutes, and share with other groups afterward.

Implement these constructors after discussion.

[The rest of the exercises will be completed during lab]
