Binary Search
---

Binary Search is an algorithm used to quickly determine the position of a particular value in a sorted collection of values.

Take a `vector<int> v` as an example.
First, we must assume that all of v's elements are in sorted order.
If we want to find the value `15`, we start in the middle.
If the value there is greater than `15`, we know that what we're looking for must be to the left!

So we repeat the process for the left half;
Look at the middle value in the remaining range.
If the value there is less than `15` we know that the value must be to the right!

Of course, if we find `15` at any point, we're done.
If we run out of elements to check, `15` doesn't exist in `v`.

By inspection, we see that each time we look for a value, we get rid of half of the remaining elements to search through.
The mathematical equivalent to this is: given size `n`, how many times does `2` divide `n`.
This can be answered with the `log` function.

In the *best* case, we will find the value we're looking for immediately.

In the *worst* case, it will take us `log(n)` tries, where `n` is the number of elements.
