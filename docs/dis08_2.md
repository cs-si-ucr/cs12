strcpy solution
---

```c++
// assume that the pointers will not be null
// if we can't assume that, a simple
//     if (dest == NULL || src == NULL) {
//         return;
//     }
// will fix that.

void strcpy(char* dest, const char* src) {
    // simplest case is when the source cstring is empty.
    if (*src == '\0') {
        // reached the end of the characters!
        // copy it, and return
        *dest = *src;
        return;
    }

    // this code applies to everything that's NOT the base case
    // (the base case can't get to this point!)

    // I need to copy the whole string, but I don't know how.
    // how about I copy this current character, and recurse on the rest of the string?
    // I trust that the strcpy function works as specified for the simpler string.

    // copy just this character
    *dest = *src;

    // call the function on the rest of the characters
    strcpy(dest + 1, src + 1);
}
```


strcmp
---

Write the `strcmp` function recursively.

`strcmp` compares two cstrings.<br>
`-1` is returned if the left is less than the right.<br>
`0` is returned if the two strings are equal.<br>
`1` is returned if the left is greater than the right.

"greater than" and "less than" above indicate lexicographical comparison.

<br>If you do not wish to work on this function, you may instead complete....


Merge Sort
---

Merge Sort is an efficient algorithm to sort things.

First, you split a collection of numbers into two halves.
Then, you sort the left half and the right half (this is done recursively using Merge Sort).
After the left and the right are sorted, you combine the two halves.

(you may use as much extra memory as you'd like)
