Arrays and cstrings
---

If you have any questions about arrays from your reading, now would be the time to ask them.

Today, we will be working primarily with `char` arrays, known as cstrings.
Cstrings are used to hold string information (without any of the member functions, of course).
String literals, as we've discussed previously, actually have a type of `const char[]`.

Cstrings are terminated by a character with value 0.
The character literal of that is `\0`.


<!-- Note to maintainer:

This was midterm week, and a slow one at that.
The original plan was to cover cstrings during lab and review the midterm, but hardly anyone showed up and we only went over the midterm.
I pushed the exercises to the second discussion, but no one showed up to that session either.
Finally, I moved the cstring exercises to week 6, and that is where you will now find them.

Cheers,
