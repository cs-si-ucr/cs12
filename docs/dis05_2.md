Arrays and cstrings
---

If you have any questions about arrays from your reading, now would be the time to ask them.

Today, we will be working primarily with `char` arrays, known as cstrings.
Cstrings are used to hold string information (without any of the member functions, of course).
String literals, as we've discussed previously, actually have a type of `const char[]`.

Cstrings are terminated by a character with value 0.
The character literal of that is `\0`.


strlen
---

To explore the fact that cstrings are terminated with 0, write the `strlen` function.
The declaration is given below:

```c++
unsigned strlen(const char[]);
```


strcpy
---

Write a function that will copy one cstring to another.
The declaration is given below:

```c++
void strcpy(char[], const char[]);
```


strcat
---

Write a function that will append one cstring to the end of another.
The declaration is given below:

```c++
void strcat(char[], const char[]);
```


strcmp
---

Write a function that compares two strings lexicographically.
The function should behave similarly to `operator<(string, string)`.
The declaration is given below:

```c++
// accepts:
//     two strings to compare
// returns:
//     -1: lhs <  rhs
//      0: lhs == rhs
//      1: lhs  > rhs
int strcmp(const char[], const char[]);
```
