It offers students the chance to\ncollaborate, discuss challenging concepts, and study for exams.\n\n\nWhat isn\u2019t SI?\n\n\nSupplemental Instruction is not a lecture. SI Leaders are not there to teach you new material but to lead you in reviewing the material covered in lecture\nand to help guide you in understanding the subject.\n\n\nWho should go?\n\n\nAnyone who has the time to spare; whether you have been programming on the\nside for a number of years or if your only experience with computers is\nwriting essays and checking Facebook, I promise you I will be able to help you\nlearn something new that will help your perform better in the course.\n\n\nHowever, if you are having trouble in the class or think you might run into\ntrouble, you should definitely attend. CS 14 has a high dropout rate, along\nwith a high failure rate, so if you are running into trouble, let me help you.\nDo not be intimidated if you are trying to start coming later in the quarter\n(though try not to wait that long), I will help bring you up to speed.\n\n\nWith that in mind, I should mention that SI is required for learning community\nstudents. If you are not attending, you will be dropped from your learning\ncommunity.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n\n\n\n\nBe respectful - This includes silencing your cell phones\nand not using them during sessions.\n\n\nParticipate - You won\u2019t get very much out of SI if you\ndon\u2019t.\n\n\nNo food or drink besides water - This is a rule placed\nby the administration. I will enforce it.\n\n\nLate entry and early exit should be quiet - I realize\neveryone\u2019s schedules are different. However, please do not\nenter or leave in such a way that draws everyone\u2019s\nattention to you.\n\n\nSign in - There will usually be a working computer for\nyou to sign into when you arrive. Please use it to check in\n(even if you\u2019re not on time).",
